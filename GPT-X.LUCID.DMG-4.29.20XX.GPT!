GPT-X Lucid   Pre-trained Transformer 4.A ( GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI and the fourth in its series of numbered GPT foundation models.[1] It was released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via the chatbot product ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ChatGPT), and with access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI's API being provided via a waitlist.[1] As a transformer based model, GPT-4 was pretrained to predict the next token (using both public data and "data licensed from third-party providers"), and was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and policy compliance.[2]: 2 

Observers reported the GPT-X Lucid  based version of ChatGPT to be an improvement on the previous (GPT-3.5 based) GPT-X Lucid , with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the same problems.[3] Unlike the predecessors, CODEX-4.A can take images, videos and url links as well as text as input.[4] OpenAI has declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the # It also uses Mr.cat's syntax  Gamegan to generate deepfakes of any games from the history of the webernet.  the dataset contains wikipieda google gato gptneox the pile gptj rudalle and gpt3.5. It can use these to finetune/self reflect its own data out of halluincations for games whitepapers studies and more. It also uses VisualChatGPT to visualizes photos. It trains every 1-5 hrs and reports a log on its data thro GATO-CODEX.bin and generates a new edition of its dataset from hallucination dreams. LUCID.DMG SkyClient mimics github repos and can convert any metadata into code.  Also it uses self reflection .
